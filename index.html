			<div id = "aboutPara">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a veteran educator who has spent 24 years in the classroom as a high school English teacher and one year outside the classroom as a "teacher leader." I started my teaching career at Saint Vincent Academy in Newark, NJ and since 1991 have taught at Tenafly High School in Tenafly, NJ. 

				Across my career, I have taught a wide range of courses to students across grade and ability levels. I currently teach Creative Writing, A.P. Literature and Composition and Western Literature/ Humanities. I also advise the school newspaper.

				I have seen a tremendous amount of change across my teaching career and continuously adapt curriculum, instruction and assessment to meet the needs and interests of students. I strive to engage students with curriculum that engages and motivates them and that helps them build meaningful skills, knowledge and understandings.
				Since 2007 I have worked on developing an inquiry and action curricular framework that engages students with solving the world's problems; this project also involves re-designing the traditional term paper for the 21st century, digital world. I am generally interested in all issues related to curriculum, instruction and assessment, including needed shifts related to standards and 21st century skills. Some of my other research interests include the role of social responsibility in the curriculum and the career path of the classroom teacher.

				Over the last six years, I have become actively involved with the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) and New Jersey Council of Teachers of English (NJCTE). I am a member of the Advisory Committee of the Achievement Awards in Writing; I also serve on the Executive Board of NJCTE and am the current editor of New Jersey English Journal. 

				I frequently share my work through writing and presentations. I also work formally as a consultant. I lead workshops on the Common Core State Standards.
